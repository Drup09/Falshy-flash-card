# Falshy-flash-card
Flashy is a simple flash card learning application built using Python and Tkinter. The project is designed to help learners practice and memorize French words and their English translations in a fun and interactive way.
The app works by showing a French word on the front of a flash card and, after a short delay, flipping the card to reveal the English meaning. This creates an engaging learning experience similar to real flash cards.

The application uses a CSV file as the dataset, where the words are stored in French with their corresponding English translations. The Pandas library is used to handle this data efficiently, and randomization ensures that the words appear differently each time the program runs. The GUI has been developed using Tkinter, providing a clean and easy-to-use interface with card images and a simple layout.

To run the project, users only need Python installed on their system along with the Pandas library. Once the setup is complete, running the main.py file launches the application. The project folder includes the main code, an image folder for the flash card designs and logo, and the CSV dataset containing the words.

This project can be extended in multiple ways, such as adding more language packs, allowing users to create their own custom decks, tracking progress, or even introducing scoring and leaderboard features to make learning more competitive. Overall, Flashy is a lightweight yet practical project that demonstrates the use of Python for building small educational applications while integrating data handling, GUI development, and basic logic in a cohesive way.
